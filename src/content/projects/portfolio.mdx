My portfolio is using the Spectre theme. Spectre is a terminal-inspired theme for Astro, built using Astro and TypeScript. 

Designed by louisescher.

## Speedy

Spectre uses no additional frameworks, not even Tailwind. This results in incredibly fast load and build times.

## Configurable

Spectre's unique features can all be turned on or off and even modified. If you, for example, dislike the comments, you can disable them with ease.
