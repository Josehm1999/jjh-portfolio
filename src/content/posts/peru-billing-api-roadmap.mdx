Project Roadmap: Peruvian Electronic Billing API (Go/Chi, Multi-Tenant Turso)

Project Goal: Develop a RESTful API for Peruvian electronic billing (Facturación Electrónica), handling validation, XML generation, digital signature, SUNAT communication, and secure storage, with a multi-tenant database approach.

Key Tools: Go, Chi, Turso (SQLite), go-playground/validator, encoding/xml, go-pkcs12, moov-io/signedxml (or goxmldsig), terminalstatic/go-xsd-validate, wamuir/go-xslt, archive/zip, Enflick/gosoap, aws-sdk-go-v2, GORM/sqlc.
Phase 1: Core API & Project Foundation

Objective: Establish the basic API structure, configuration, and a working central database for tenant management.

    1.1. Project Setup:
        Initialize Go module (go mod init).
        Create cmd/api/main.go and internal/server directories.
        Set up basic Chi server in internal/server/server.go and routes.go.
        Implement basic HTTP server start/stop logic.
        Configure Makefile for run, build, test.
    1.2. Configuration Management:
        Set up configs/config.yaml for application settings.
        Integrate a configuration library (e.g., spf13/viper) to load settings from YAML and environment variables.
        Define initial config structs: API port, environment, Turso API key, central DB connection string.
    1.3. Central Database for Multi-Tenancy:
        Set up internal/database/central package.
        Define models.go for Tenant and APIKey (hashed).
        Initialize db.go for connection to your central Turso database (or other chosen central DB).
        Implement repo.go methods for CreateTenant, GetTenantByAPIKey.
        Write a simple script/command in cmd/api/main.go or a separate cmd/admin to seed/create a test tenant.
    1.4. Basic Health Check Endpoint:
        Add a /health endpoint in internal/handlers and internal/server/routes.go to confirm the API is running and can connect to the central database.

Phase 2: Authentication & Multi-Tenant Database Resolution

Objective: Secure the API with API keys and dynamically connect to the correct tenant's database.

    2.1. API Key Authentication Middleware:
        Develop internal/auth/middleware.go.
        Implement a Chi middleware that:
            Extracts API key from header.
            Queries internal/database/central/repo to validate the API key and retrieve tenant details (including tenant Turso DB URL/token).
            Returns 401 Unauthorized if invalid.
        Apply this middleware to all secure routes in internal/server/routes.go.
    2.2. Tenant Database Manager:
        Develop internal/database/tenant/manager.go.
        Implement a manager struct that:
            Takes the Turso API key from config.
            Has methods like GetTenantDB(tenantID string, dbURL string, dbToken string) (*sql.DB, error).
            Internally caches *sql.DB connections for active tenants to avoid re-opening connections.
            Uses the Turso SDK (or direct HTTP calls) for programmatic database creation/management if building an admin interface for tenant signup.
        Crucial: Ensure the GetTenantDB method returns a ready-to-use *sql.DB connection for the specific tenant.
    2.3. Context Integration:
        Define internal/types/context_keys.go for TenantIDKey and TenantDBClientKey.
        Modify internal/auth/middleware.go to store TenantID and the resolved tenant *sql.DB connection in the context.Context after successful authentication.
    2.4. Tenant Database Migrations:
        Implement schema definition for the tenant-specific tables (e.g., invoices, cdr_responses).
        Add logic in internal/database/tenant/db.go (or in your manager.go) to apply these migrations when a new tenant database is provisioned or on application startup/migration command.

Phase 3: Inbound Request Processing (Validation, XML, Signature)

Objective: Handle incoming billing requests, validate them, convert to UBL XML, and apply digital signatures.

    3.1. Billing Request Models & Handler:
        Define internal/billing/models.go for the incoming JSON request structure.
        Create internal/handlers/billing_handler.go with a handler for the /billing endpoint (e.g., POST /v1/billing/invoice).
        This handler will receive the JSON, extract the tenant DB client from context, and pass the request to internal/billing/service.go.
    3.2. Request Validation:
        Set up internal/pkg/validation/request_validator.go using go-playground/validator.
        Integrate this into the billing_handler to validate the incoming JSON request against predefined rules.
    3.3. JSON to UBL XML Conversion:
        Create internal/pkg/json_to_xml/converter.go.
        Define internal/pkg/sunat_models/ubl21.go with Go structs tagged for encoding/xml to represent the UBL 2.1 XML structure. This is the most complex data modeling part.
        Implement logic to map the validated incoming JSON request into these UBL Go structs and then marshal them into an XML string.
    3.4. Digital Certificate Loading:
        Develop internal/pkg/certs/loader.go using go-pkcs12 to load the private key and certificate chain from .p12 files.
        Store certificate paths in configs/config.yaml and .p12 files in tmp/certs (or a secure secrets manager in production).
    3.5. XML Digital Signature:
        Implement internal/pkg/digital_signature/signer.go.
        Integrate moov-io/signedxml (or goxmldsig) to apply the XMLDSig signature to the UBL XML document.
        Ensure the signature is placed correctly within the <ext:UBLExtension/ext:ExtensionContent> as required by SUNAT.

Phase 4: Outbound Processing (XSD, XSLT, Zipping, SOAP)

Objective: Validate the signed XML, apply transformations, package it, and send it to SUNAT via SOAP.

    4.1. XSD Validation:
        Set up internal/pkg/validation/xsd_validator.go using terminalstatic/go-xsd-validate.
        Load SUNAT's XSD schemas from tmp/xsd (downloaded from SUNAT's portal).
        Implement validation of the signed UBL XML against these schemas.
    4.2. XSLT Transformations (if needed):
        Implement internal/pkg/validation/xslt_transformer.go using wamuir/go-xslt.
        Load XSLT files from tmp/xslt.
        Apply any necessary XSLT transformations to the XML (e.g., for specific SUNAT requirements or internal processing).
    4.3. XML Zipping:
        Create internal/pkg/zipper/zipper.go using Go's archive/zip package.
        Implement logic to zip the final XML file, typically naming it with the RUC, document type, and series/number.
    4.4. SUNAT SOAP Client:
        Develop internal/pkg/soap_client/client.go.
        Integrate Enflick/gosoap.
        Implement the SOAP request structure for SUNAT's WebService (e.g., sendBill, sendSummary, sendPack).
        Crucial: Implement WS-Security UsernameToken header manipulation. This might require custom code if gosoap doesn't provide direct support. You'll need to concatenate RUC + User (from config) for the Username and use the Clave SOL password.
        Configure SUNAT WSDL URLs in configs/config.yaml for both beta and production.

Phase 5: Response Handling & Storage

Objective: Process SUNAT's response, store results in the tenant database, and media files in object storage.

    5.1. SUNAT Response Handling:
        Within internal/pkg/soap_client/client.go, parse SUNAT's SOAP response.
        Extract the CDR (Constancia de Recepción) XML and any other relevant data (e.g., status, error codes).
    5.2. Tenant Database Storage:
        In internal/database/tenant/repositories.go, add methods to save:
            Initial invoice request metadata.
            The current status of the billing process (e.g., PENDING, SIGNED, SENT, ACCEPTED, REJECTED).
            Relevant SUNAT response details (CDR content, status code).
            References (URLs) to files stored in object storage.
    5.3. Object Storage Integration:
        Set up internal/pkg/object_storage/storage.go using aws-sdk-go-v2.
        Implement methods to upload:
            The original JSON request.
            The generated (and signed) UBL XML.
            The SUNAT CDR XML.
            The PDF representation (if generated by a separate service or internally).
        Ensure proper file naming conventions (e.g., {tenant_id}/{document_type}/{invoice_id}/{timestamp}.xml).
    5.4. PDF Generation (Optional, Phase 6):
        Decide if you will generate PDFs internally (more complex, consider a library like unidoc/unipdf or jung-kurt/gofpdf) or if this will be a separate service. For a side project, initially consider relying on the XML or a separate tool.
    5.5. Status Update Endpoint:
        Add internal/handlers/status_handler.go to allow users to query the status of their submitted billing documents using the internal/database/tenant/repositories.go.

Phase 6: Robustness, Monitoring & Asynchronous Processing

Objective: Make the API more robust, observable, and handle long-running tasks gracefully.

    6.1. Comprehensive Error Handling:
        Define custom errors in internal/types/errors.go for specific API issues (e.g., ValidationError, SunatError, InternalServerError).
        Implement consistent error responses for API clients.
        Add structured logging (e.g., zap or logrus) throughout the application for debugging and operational insights.
    6.2. Asynchronous Queueing (for background tasks):
        Integrate hibiken/asynq (or similar) in cmd/api/main.go and internal/billing/service.go.
        Refactor the billing workflow:
            The HTTP handler receives the request, performs initial validation, saves a "PENDING" status to the tenant DB, and pushes the request to a Redis-backed queue.
            A separate worker process (part of the same Go binary, or a distinct process) consumes from the queue and performs the heavy lifting (XML, signing, SOAP call, database updates, object storage).
            This decouples the API response from long-running operations.
    6.3. Metrics & Monitoring:
        Integrate Prometheus metrics (e.g., prometheus/client_golang) to expose API request counts, latencies, error rates, and queue sizes.
        Set up basic alerting.
    6.4. Retries & Idempotency:
        Implement retry logic for external calls (SOAP to SUNAT, Turso API calls, S3/R2 uploads) with backoff.
        Design for idempotency where possible to prevent duplicate processing if retries occur.

Phase 7: Testing & Deployment

Objective: Ensure correctness, stability, and prepare for production.

    7.1. Unit Tests:
        Write unit tests for all internal/pkg components (json_to_xml, digital_signature, soap_client, validation, etc.).
        Write unit tests for internal/billing/service with mocks for external dependencies.
    7.2. Integration Tests:
        Write integration tests for handlers (internal/handlers) to verify API responses and interaction with internal/billing/service.
        Test the internal/database layers against a real (test) central and tenant database.
        Crucial: Plan for testing the SUNAT SOAP integration. This will likely involve using SUNAT's beta/test environment (homologación) extensively, as direct production testing is not feasible.
    7.3. End-to-End Tests:
        Simulate a full billing request from API call to successful storage and SUNAT response.
    7.4. Dockerization:
        Create a Dockerfile for your Go application.
        Include necessary libxml2 and libxslt dependencies via a multi-stage build.
    7.5. Deployment Strategy:
        Choose your deployment platform (Render, Fly.io, etc.).
        Configure environment variables for production secrets.
        Set up CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployment.
